Learned how to create a table in HTML by displaying various facts about the planets in our solar system. 
Used various HTML elements including table, colgroup, col, thead, tr, th, td, tbody to create the data cells for the table. 
Also used table attributes such as colspan and rowspan to join data cells together to make them look neater.
Added some simple styling to the elements and data cells to make it more appealing and easier to read.
